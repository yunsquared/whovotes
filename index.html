      <h3>Broadband versus voting </h3>

      <h1>Visualizing the Digital Divide</h1>

      <p>
        The “digital divide” was first identified by the Clinton Administration 
        as a pressing concern separating those who have internet access and those 
        who do not. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Over two decades later, the number of Americans who lack access 
        to fixed broadband service at threshold speeds remains high at 19 million. 
        We’re interested in understanding how limited broadband access in the digital 
        age impacts voting patterns and turnout in both local and general elections.

      <h2>Our Goal</h2>

      <p>
        Our goal is to produce a set of informational and interactive data visualizations, 
        as we feel data visualizations are an ideal way to summarize our research findings 
        and bring awareness and increased visibility. This project’s end product is intended 
        to be easily accessible via a domain to help viewers identify communities
        most vulnerable to limited information access for making informed voting decisions.
