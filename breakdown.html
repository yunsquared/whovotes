      <h2>162 Million Americans Lack Broadband Internet. This is nearly half of the U.S. Population.</h2>

      <p>Identified by the Clinton Administration in the 1990’s, the “digital divide” at face value is the gap between those who have internet access and those who do not. However, it is crucial to understand the actual nuances in this pressing issue. In research and political discourse, the dichotomous digital divide is oversimplified as a binary problem. People either have internet access or they do not. Deeper research reveals that disparities relating to the digital divide are not solely technological - they are also economic, social, political, and cultural (Selwyn, 2004).</p>

      <p>Existing research and previous approaches to our research question are fairly generalized. Studies either focus on various western countries or focus on different consequences of the digital divide, excluding voter turnout. Very little research exists today that looks exclusively at the patterns between voter turnout and access to broadband internet services. To produce a comprehensive mental model of the issue at hand, it is important to understand all facets of that issue.</p>

      <p>Below we explore the many facets of the immensely complex and growing issue of the Digital Divide. </p><br><br>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Understanding Information and Communication Technology</button>
      <div class="content">
<p>The use of information and communications technology (ICT) within nations has symbolized social and economic progress throughout the 21st century (Selwyn, 2004). However, we now understand that an information society does not mean an informed society (Bonfadelli, 2002). Previously, ICT was vaguely defined in terms of computer hardware and software. We now know that ICT spans beyond the computer (i.e. TV, game consoles, etc.). Thus, ICT serves as an umbrella term for various technological applications such as computer hardware and software, broadcasting technologies, and telecommunications. In addition, due to the plurality of these technologies, the content provided must also be considered. Finally, when we refer to ICT, this includes a range of technologies, types of information, and resources.<br></p>
<p>"In other words, the digital divide can be seen also in terms of the information, resources, applications, and services that individuals are accessing via new technologies." - Neil Selwyn</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Causes of The Digital Divide</button>
      <div class="content">
<p>People are digitally divided and excluded in different ways that may not seem obvious at first. Below we look deeper into the types of divides that contribute to the digital divide.
<br></p>
<p>The 'Access' Divide:<br></p>
<p>Defining access in terms of ‘availability’ masks the nuances in the context of ICT access. “Issues of time, cost, quality of the technology, and the environment in which it is used, as well as more ‘qualitative’ concerns of privacy and ‘ease of use’ are all crucial mediating factors in people’s access to ICT” (Davis, 1993; Selwyn et al.,2000). Think about how you would interact with your own personal computer versus how you would interact with a public shared computer at the library<br></p>
<p>The 'Use' Divide:<br></p>
<p>“Material access to a technology is useless without the requisite skills, knowledge and support to use it effectively” (van Dijk, 1999). We cannot assume that ownership of ICT leads to the use of ICT. Scholars have overlooked this concept in the past when they attributed the disparities in ICT to the s-curve of adoption of technology technology. Assuming the s-curve of adoption of technology is an accurate model leads us to believe that once ICT is widespread, the only ones without it are those who either reject technology or reject information. This, again, ignores the complexities between ‘access to’ and ‘use of’. Furthermore, use does not necessarily mean ‘meaningful use’ or ‘engagement’.<br></p>
<p>Below is the s-curve of adoption of technology and examples of technology where we see this model holds true. In this model, adopters are divided into ‘innovators’, ‘early adopters’, ‘early majority’, ‘late majority’, and ‘laggards’. In the context of the digital divide, ‘laggards’ is the section that is particularly harmful. Everett Rogers was the scholar who popularized adoption curves beginning in 1962. Rogers describes laggards as traditionalists who are fixated on the past and often skeptical of any forms of innovation (1971). By the time a laggard adopts a technology, it is dated. This suggests that people who do not have the technology are voluntarily choosing not to consume it. This obviously is not the case for those who fall victim to the pangs of the digital divide.<br></p>
<p>The 'Engagement' Divide:<br></p>
<p>Engagement with ICT is influenced by the individual’s social, psychological, and economic environment. An information society does not mean an informed society (Bonfadelli, 2002). “Engagement with ICT is therefore less concerned with issues of access and ownership but more about how people develop relationships with ICTs and how they are capable of making use of the social resources which make access useable” (Garnham, 1997; Jung et al.,2001).
When we observe facets of engagement in society, we see can begin to see how those types of engagement are reflected in engagement with ICT. Below is a list of these types of engagement provided by ICT scholar Neil Selwyn:<br></p>
<ul>
  <li>Production activity: economically or socially valued activities; such as education or paid-work</li>
  <li>Political activity: activities that collectively improve or protect the social and physical environment</li>
  <li>Social activity: significant social interactions with others</li>
  <li>Consumption activity: consuming goods and services enough--but not too much--to support society</li>
  <li>Savings activity: saving money, property, or entitlements</li>
</ul>
<p>ICT can help or hurt our ability to fufill these roles in society.<br></p>
<p>These types of divides begin to reveal the underlying structural issues in society that is presented in the digital divide.</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Consequences of The Digital Divide</button>
      <div class="content">
<p>The list of consequences on society from being digitally divided is extensive and ever-growing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the digital divide was visible more than ever as everyday life ceased and we became heavily reliant on remote technologies.<br></p>
<p>Consequences on mental wellbeing: Rural and urban residents who do not have access to the internet are disconnected which causes feelings of social isolation. Older adults are more at risk of experiencing loneliness and depression and oftentimes rely on information and communication technology to alleviate this (Cotten et al., 2013).</p>
