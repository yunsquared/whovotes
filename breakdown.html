      <h2>162 Million Americans Lack Broadband Internet. This is nearly half of the U.S. Population.</h2>

      <p>Identified by the Clinton Administration in the 1990’s, the “digital divide” at face value is the gap between those who have internet access and those who do not. However, it is crucial to understand the actual nuances in this pressing issue. In research and political discourse, the dichotomous digital divide is oversimplified as a binary problem. People either have internet access or they do not. Deeper research reveals that disparities relating to the digital divide are not solely technological - they are also economic, social, political, and cultural (Selwyn, 2004).</p> 

      <p>Existing research and previous approaches to our research question are fairly generalized. Studies either focus on various western countries or focus on different consequences of the digital divide, excluding voter turnout. Very little research exists today that looks exclusively at the patterns between voter turnout and access to broadband internet services. To produce a comprehensive mental model of the issue at hand, it is important to understand all facets of that issue.</p>

      <p>Below we explore the many facets of the immensely complex and growing issue of the Digital Divide. </p>

<p>The use of information and communications technology (ICT) within nations has symbolized social and economic progress throughout the 21st century (Selwyn, 2004). However, we now understand that an information society does not mean an informed society (Bonfadelli, 2002). Previously, ICT was vaguely defined in terms of computer hardware and software. We now know that ICT spans beyond the computer (i.e. TV, game consoles, etc.). Thus, ICT serves as an umbrella term for various technological applications such as computer hardware and software, broadcasting technologies, and telecommunications. In addition, due to the plurality of these technologies, the content provided must also be considered. Finally, when we refer to ICT, this includes a range of technologies, types of information, and resources.<br></p>
